# 🧠 Explainable Sentiment Analysis on Hotel Reviews

## ✨ Overview

This project performs **binary sentiment analysis** on hotel reviews sourced from **TripAdvisor**, with a specific focus on the use of **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to interpret and understand model decisions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data processing, model training, and XAI methods
- **MongoDB**: Storage of raw and processed review data

## 🎯 Objectives

- Classify reviews into **positive** or **negative** sentiment
- Apply **Explainable AI** (e.g., LIME, SHAP) to:
  - Understand which words or phrases influenced the prediction
  - Build **trustworthy and interpretable models**
- Provide actionable insights based on model explanations

## 📦 Dataset

- **Source**: TripAdvisor hotel reviews  
- The dataset includes user-generated reviews labeled by sentiment (positive/negative)

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
2. **Sentiment Classification**
   - Train/test split
   - Use of ML/DL models (e.g., Logistic Regression, BERT)
3. **Explainability**
   - Application of **LIME** and **SHAP** to visualize model behavior

## 📊 Outcomes

- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visual explanations of model predictions
- Insights into **key linguistic patterns** that drive sentiment
